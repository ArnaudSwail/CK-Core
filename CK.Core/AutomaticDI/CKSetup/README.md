# CKSetup "duck typed" attributes

This set of attributes are used by CKSetup processes to tag assemblies:

- "Models" contain minimalist abstract contracts and attributes.
- "SetupDependency" contain nitty-gritty implementations of code generators and other processes that are often called "Engines".
